 STEP 1: Implement Cart Features

Create APIs:

Add product to cart

Update quantity

Remove product from cart

View cart with total amount

This is the first major logic part.

STEP 2: Create "Place Order" API

This is very important.

When user clicks "Place Order":

Logic:

Get cart by user

Create new Order

For each CartItem:

Create OrderItem

Calculate total

Save Order

Clear Cart

This is core eCommerce logic

 STEP 3: Order Status Flow

Your Status enum should look like:

PENDING
CONFIRMED
SHIPPED
DELIVERED
CANCELLED

Create API to:

Update order status (admin only)

View user orders
